# MuSCoW

|Instructions|
|----|
|A MuSCoW mean **Mu**st, **S**hould, **Co**uld, **W**ont: each line should be a user story, constraint, criteria, feature, parameter, or something else that describes and defines you project. If it is important to the project write it down, if you don't how is the next guy supposed to know to consider it.|
|Each line must explained and then dispositioned as Must/Should/Could/Wont below are examples of each disposition.  Feel free to cut and paste the samples below|
